<p>Amy Ochterski’s horse, Kiefer, wasn’t feeling well. He’d been colicing, rolling over, experiencing abdominal pain likely due to something he ingested. 
<br>
<br>
  So, Octerski’s veterinarian took a fecal sample, and Kiefer's worm count came back at 300. It was "a lot of worms," and what Ochterski needed was a  common, cheap horse dewormer, ivermectin. 
  <br>
<br>
  "I went out looking for a plain ivermectin," Ochterski said. "I went to our local farm stores.”
  </p>

  <span class="image left"><div><img src="images/kiefer.jpg" alt="" height="400px"/><i>Kiefer | Credit: Amy Ochterski</i></div></span>

<p>
  But Ochterski couldn’t find it, anywhere. She’s not the only one. 
  <br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.ncdhhs.gov/">The North Carolina Department of Health and Humans Services</a> (NCDHHS) said it is aware of a “growing public interest” for using ivermectin as a treatment for COVID-19. The drug is flying off the shelvers, leaving horse owners like Ochterski in a complicated medical situation.

<br>
<br>
However, in a <a href = "https://www.ncmedboard.org/images/uploads/other_pdfs/North_Carolina_DHHS_Ivermectin_Notice_-_final.pdf">Sept. 14 release</a>, North Carolina State Health Director Dr. Elizabeth Tilson said the antiparasitic drug is not authorized by the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/">U.S. Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) to treat or prevent COVID-19. 
</p>



<p>It's a sentiment feed stores across the United States are trying to stress to potential customers.
  According to the FDA, there is not enough data to show if ivermectin is effective against the coronavirus in humans or animals.
</p>

  </div>
  
<p>“Prescribers should exercise caution if prescribing a drug outside FDA authorization or approval,” the release said. “We have received reports of an increase in prescriptions for ivermectin, as well as poison control calls and emergency department visits connected to ivermectin.”
  <br>
  <br>
  NCDHHS declined a request for an interview on the topic, but data from <a href="https://www.iqvia.com/">IQVIA</a> backs up the department’s claim. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Ivermectin prescriptions dispened from retail pharmacies in the United States jumped approximately 353.7% from the week of July 9 to Aug. 13, according to <a href="https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2021/han00449.asp">data</a> from IQVIA’s National Prescription Audit Weekly. 
  <br>
  <br>
  During what IQVIA called the “pre-pandemic period,” August 2019 to mid-March 2020, prescriptions averaged 3,625 a week. According to the data, 88,168 prescriptions were dispensed during the week of Aug. 13, 2021 alone. 
  </p>

  <!-- <span class="image fit"><div><img src="images/banner.jpg" alt="" /><i>Caption for the photo goes here and here and herey.</i></div></span> -->


<p>A spokesperson for IQVIA said the analyst group did not look at prescription breakdown by state. 
<br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.ncpoisoncontrol.org/">North Carolina Poison Control</a> said it is not seeing “widespread ivermectin misuse.” A spokesperson for the organization said in a statement that NC Poison Control does not suggest using “any drugs in an unapprove way, including ivermectin, to treat COVID.”

<h2>'I thought it was nuts. I thought there's no way that's really happening.'</h2>

<p>“I have a friend that has horses, and she said she couldn’t find it,” Elle Kimsey said in reference to Ochterski’s inability to find ivermectin. “She said something like, ‘It’s people taking it for COVID,’ and I thought she was being dramatic, but sounds like that might actually be part of it.”
<br>
<br>
  Kimsey, who owns <a href="http://www.joyrideeq.com/">JoyRide Equestrian</a> in Pittsboro, said it is “mind boggling” that people are using ivermectin as a COVID-19 treatment. Kimsey said horses get their own coronaviruses, and dewormers aren’t used to treat them.

<p>"A drug that's meant to kill internal parasites isn't going to have any effect that I know of on a virus," Kimsey said. "And like I said, there may be applications where you could use it in some way, but it's not for us to say, that would be for a doctor or veterinarian to prescibe. My horses that had horse coronavirus...we did fever reducers."
<br>
<br>
  There is a human version of ivermectin. According to NCDHHS, it is approved to treat head lice and skin conditions like rosacea. In fact, there’s multiple versions of the antiparasitc for animals including dogs and cats. 
  <br>
<br>
  “Most notably, ivermectin is approved for use in animals for prevention of heartworm disease and for treatment of certain parasites,” State Health Director Dr. Elizabeth Tilson said in a release.

<br>
  "It's dosed for 1500 pounds," Kimsey said. "So, even if you like did the math and spun the dial down to a 100 or 200 pounds person, it may not be anywhere near accurate."
  <br>
<br>
  Kimsey said she collects fecal samples from her horses twice a year for her veteranarian to analyze. 
  <br>
<br>
  “We expect them to have some, but we want to keep that load really low,” Kimsey said. “We expect them to have some because they’re eating off of the ground and that’s where the parasite eggs and larvae are.”

<p>
  If a horse is seeing a higher concentration of worms, then a veterinarian might recommend a dewormer, like ivermectin, or even something stronger. This is what happened to Ochterski and Kiefer. 
<br>
<br>
Ochterski said her veterinarian suggested starting with ivermectin to treat her horse but said to follow up three weeks later with a mix of ivermectin and another antiparasitic. 

</p>


<h2>Is there a future for ivermectin in teh COVID-19 world?</h2>

<p>
  Octherski said it is rare that horse owners are taking fecal samples of their horses in August and September, as usually the process takes place in the late fall. She said she was “blown away” and mad that she couldn’t seem to find the dewormer anywhere. 

  <br>
  <br>
  
  “I live out in Chapel Hill, so I went to a one in Piedmont off of 54. Didn't have it. I went to the Southern States, they didn't have it. And then I went to the Pittsboro feed store, and they didn't have it. I tried online. I tried <a href="https://www.smartpakequine.com/ps/ivermectin-apple-flavor-paste-6127">SmartPak</a>, which is like an online store for horse people. They're out of it. I tried <a href="https://www.chewy.com/durvet-ivermectin-paste-187-apple/dp/261109">Chewy</a> through my cat. They're out of it. So, finally, my friend just gave me...she had a tube."

<p>Ochterski said if her friend didn't have an extra tube of ivermectin she would have probably given her horse the mixed version. It would have been stronger than she wanted. 
<br>
<br>
  “I would have worried about it, but that would have been my go-to,” Ochterski said. “Fortunately, horse people hoard things.”
  <br>
<br>
Ochterski said she saw in a Facebook Group that some feed stores are requiring individuals to show a photo of their horse before purchasing ivermectin. According to the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/09/19/ivermectin-horse-dewormer-owners-covid/">Washington Post</a>, V&V Tack and Feed in Las Vegas posted a sign saying customers “MUST SHOW A PIC OF YOU AND YOUR HORSE.”

  Doug Allred, external communications manager for Cone Health, said the hospital has seen "potentially" two emergency department visits related to ivermectin in the last 180 days, or about six months.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Never use medications intended for animals on yourself or other people,” NCDHHS said in the release. “Animal ivermectin products are very different from those approved for humans. Use of animal ivermectin for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19 in humans is dangerous.”
  <br>
<br>
  Clinical trials are underway to see if ivermectin could prove effective against COVID-19. There are 78 studies, with statuses from completed to terminated, associated with both ivermectin and COVID-19, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine’s <a href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=COVID-19&term=ivermectin&cntry=&state=&city=&dist=&Search=Search">website</a>.
